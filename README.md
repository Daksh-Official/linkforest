# 🌲 LinkForest – A Linktree Clone

**LinkForest** is a customizable link management platform that lets users create a single profile page to share all their important links — similar to Linktree.  
Built with **Next.js**, **MongoDB**, and **TailwindCSS**, it offers both a clean UI and scalable backend.

## 🔒 Security Notes
1. This project uses a local MongoDB instance by default.
2. Data is shared among all users and not isolated per account.
3. Do not use this in production without proper authentication.
4. Use MongoDB Atlas + NextAuth (or JWT) to enable secure multi-user data separation.

## 🧠 How It Works
=> User creates a unique handle (like @daksh).<br>
=> The app stores their profile and links in MongoDB.<br>
=> Visitors can access the user’s public page at /@handle.<br>
=> Each profile dynamically loads its links from the database.
